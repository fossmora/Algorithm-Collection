  a = a * 5	# multiplied by 5
  ```

The below commentations is regarded pleasent. 
  ```python
 # multiplied by 5
  a = a * 5	
  ```
  ```python
  a = a * 5	
  # multiplied by 5
  ```


#### Other Requirements for Submissions
- We encourage using CamelCase for file names. 

> ex: SumOfArray

- Please try to fit your work into the existing folder structure.

- If you have changed or added code, verify that it compiles before making the pull request.
- Try your best to keep your comments and any other documentation, without any language or gramatical errors.
